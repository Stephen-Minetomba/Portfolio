# About me
My name is **Stephen**, I was born in **Bucharest**, and I learnt **Python**, **Rust**, **Go** and **C** when I was **14 years old**.

## About this repository
This repository will contain most of my coding projects, free and open source (still, don't copy them and use them like you were the one who created them).
